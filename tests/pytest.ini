Introduction
The pytest.ini file is a configuration file for pytest. This file allows customizing the behavior of pytest,
defining custom markers, configuration options, and more, to suit the specific needs of your project.

Structure and Example
[pytest]: The main section where all pytest configurations are defined.
markers: Defines custom markers that can be used to categorize tests. In this case, a marker named asyncio is defined, which can be used to mark tests that use asyncio.

Available Configurations
Besides markers, pytest.ini can contain several other configurations, including:

addopts: Allows specifying default command-line options for pytest.
testpaths: Specifies directories that pytest should search for tests.
python_files: Defines the patterns of file names that pytest will consider as test files.
python_classes: Specifies the patterns of class names that pytest will treat as test classes.
python_functions: Defines the patterns of function names that pytest will consider as test functions.
filterwarnings: Allows specifying how pytest should treat Python warnings during test execution.
These configurations provide great flexibility to tailor pytest to the specific needs of your project, facilitating the execution and organization of your tests.
